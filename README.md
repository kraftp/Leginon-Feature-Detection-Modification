Leginon Feature Detection Patch
======================================

This is an unofficial patch of Leginon, created by NRAMM.  It improves feature detection for RCT and OTR.  It requires Leginon 3.0.  To install, simply copy and paste the files into your Leginon directory, allowing overwriting.  The patch overwrites two files--leginon/RCTacquisition.py and its GUI, leginon/gui/wx/RCTAquisition.py.  In addition to all Leginon dependencies, the patch requires OpenCV version 2.9 or later with its Python bindings.
